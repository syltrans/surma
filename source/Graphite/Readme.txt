This file describes the process for producing Graphite files for the Surma font.

The source font is assumed to be present in the Surma-Regular.ufo folder.

stddef.gdh is a definition header file to define standard abbreviations and constants. It is #included at the top of Surma-master.gdl.

Surma-master.gdl contains the glyph definitions and glyph classes for the font. 

Surma-glyphs.gdl will be autogenerated by make_gdl.
